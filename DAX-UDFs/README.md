## 🧩 DAX UDFs Overview

*Note: as the UDFs are still  in preview, consider this repository also in preview and in a "BETA" stage.*

This repository contains a collection of the User Defined Functions (UDFs) for DAX I created to allow complex logics to be written once and reused across multiple models, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.
