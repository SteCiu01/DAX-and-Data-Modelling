# DAX & Data Modelling

A production-tested collection of DAX codes, data modelling techniques, and best practices for Power BI semantic models.

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive reference library for building robust Power BI semantic models and reports. Each code is production-ready and is documented with clear examples, use cases, and implementation guidelines.

All examples are **generalized and reusable** — designed to be easily adapted to your specific use cases.

[🧮 DAX Codes & Best Practices](https://github.com/SteCiu01/DAX-and-Data-Modelling/blob/main/DAX-Codes/README.md)

A comprehensive collection of production-tested DAX codes and data modelling techniques for Power BI semantic models. Each code is fully documented with use cases, implementation steps, practical examples and is organized by functional category:

- **Formatting** — Custom formatting logic for visuals and data labels
- **Filter Context** — Data modelling techniques for managing complex filter interactions
- **Time Intelligence** — Essential time-based calculations with optimized calendar table
- **Interactive Controls** — Dynamic filtering and navigation patterns
- **Virtual Tables** — Advanced calculation patterns using in-memory tables

[🧩 DAX UDFs](https://github.com/SteCiu01/DAX-and-Data-Modelling/blob/main/DAX-UDFs/README.md)

Reusable function library for complex logic encapsulation (Coming Soon)

## About This Repository

These resources have been developed through real-world implementations across various use cases. Each pattern represents a solved problem that was complex enough to warrant documentation and reuse.

The focus is on **practical, production-ready solutions** rather than theoretical examples — everything here has been used to solve actual business requirements in Power BI / Fabric environment.
