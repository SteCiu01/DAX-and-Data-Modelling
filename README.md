# DAX

This repository contains a collection of DAX code snippets and DAX user-defined functions that I created for my work or for some personal projects, and that I find quite interesting for their complexity or for their use case, to make them worthy to be shared. 

All examples have been generalized, and each entry includes a short description of its use case.
