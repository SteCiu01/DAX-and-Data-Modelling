# DAX, Filtering & Data Modelling

This repository contains a collection of DAX code snippets, together with Data Modelling and Filtering best practices, and DAX user-defined functions. 

These resources have been created during my work or for some personal projects, they are generally production-tested, and I find them quite interesting for their complexity or for their use case, to make them worthy to be shared here. 

All examples are generalized, to make them easily re-used.

Feel free to fork them and propose changes/enhancements.
