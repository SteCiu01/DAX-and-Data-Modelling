# DAX & Data Modelling

This repository contains a collection of DAX codes and UDFs, together with data modelling best practices. 

All examples are generalized, to make them easily re-used.

Feel free to fork them and propose changes/enhancements.

*Note: these are resources that have been created during my work or for some personal projects, they are generally production-tested, and I find them quite interesting for their complexity or for their use case, to make them worthy to be shared here.*
